    -In the development of rotors, The brushless DC motors are the way to go due to their high reliability and easy control techniques.
  Most brushless motors are controlled via an Electronic Speed Controller, or for short ESC, to alternate the voltage inside the coils 
  so that the rotor part spins. 
    -Most motors used in rotors are called outrunners, which means that the outer part of the motor is spinning around a fixed coil of 
    copper wire windings inside, this type of motors allow for high Rpm, and thus higher controllability of the motor speed.
    -The ESC sends a receives a PWM signal which varies between 1000(min) to 2000(max) micro senconds on which it determines the voltage 
  that will alter the motor rpm and thus the speed and thrust it's providing.
    -Motors are commonly rated based on the Kv,which is the number of revolutions per minute (rpm) that a motor turns when 1V (one volt) 
  is applied with no load attached to that motor. A General rule of the thumb, Higher Kv means lower thrust and lower torque and a small
  propeller size, Lower Kv means Lower rpm , but higher thrust and higher rpm with a large propeller size.

  -The motor usually comes with three wire terminals wich goes into the ESC, The wires indicate the Positive, Negative and Ground polarities,
the middle wire should always be connected to its middle counterpart in the ESC and the side wires can be exchanged to change the spin 
direction of the motor.
  -Make sure to ply 3mm of each wire of the 3 and tin it with the solder if it's not tinned, Put some solder in the male pin and make sure
that the size of the male - female connector are the same,The connector used in this wiring is called Bullet connectors which come in 
different sizes measured from the female connector diameter in mm.
  -Always make sure that the plied wire tips are immersed in the solder in the connector and remember to add the heat shrink before soldering
and also make sure that the heat shrink cover only the uniform circular part not the whole connector.
-Apply the heat shrink using a lighter or a heat gun and then make sure that each connection is well isolated and that no short circut
will occur due to bare metal touching of the connections
  -Fix the motor in the vehicle desired and then put on the propeller and make sure the propeller nuts are well tight. Always read the manual
or ask if you don't know how to do something, specially when it can cause losses.
  -After installing the motors and propeller, Connect the esc to the radio and check for the spinning direction on 5 to 10% thrust, if you
can't make the direction, simple add a piece of tape to a side of the motor outrunner and check how it rotates.

* The motor speed isn't changing by changing the throttle
- The ESC needs calibration

* The motor twitch on low throttle but spins fine after it
- This is known as lag and it happens normally as remotes send a 1000 μs and the motor needs a minimum of 1050 μs, it's common with 
some new motors to prevent spinning on the lowest throttle.

* The motor twitch on low throttle and doesn't spin after
- First, check if the nails not touching the windings of the motor specially if you're not using the ones that came with the motor.
- Make sure that the soldered connection are good and no wire hairs are loose.
- Make sure nothing is jamming the outrunner part.

* The motor doesn't spin but doesn't get hot
- Make sure that the wires are connected well and that the ESC is working.

* The motor doesn't spin but get hot
-Mostly this motor is fried, But to make sure, Hook up the motor with a well known working esc if it spins, then the connections to 
the old ESC is bananas, if it doesn't spin then take out the outrunner part, re align the magnets inside , re wind the coil wires and 
make sure that there is no blockage between the winding and the outrunner part.
-Check if the wire leads are well connected to the windings in the motor.

* The motor spins but gets hot a lot
- Motors usually doesn't generate large heat due to the high airflow through the propeller, but if the motor gets very hot you should
check the connections and re wind the coil wires as in such case the resistance of the motors is high.
- Check if the wires between the ESC and the motor are hot, if yes , replace them as their resistance is high, if not check the connection
then the ESC it self and then the motor.
- Make sure that the ESC and Battery are designed to work on the battery size you are using.
- Make sure that the Propeller size you are using is suitable for the motor.
