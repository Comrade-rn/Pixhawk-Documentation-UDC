    -In the development of rotors, The brushless DC motors are the way to go due to their high reliability and rasy control techniques.
  Most brushless motors are controlled via an Electronic Speed Controller, or for short ESC, to alternate the voltage inside the coils 
  so that the rotor part spin. 
    -Most motors are called outrunners, which means that the outer part of the motor is spinning around a fixed coil of copper wire 
  windings inside, this type of motors allow for high Rpm, and thus higher controllability of the motor speed.
    -The ESC sends a recives a PWM signal which varies between 1000(min) to 2000(max) micro senconds on which it determines the voltage 
  that will alter the motor rpm and thus the speed and thrust it's providing.
