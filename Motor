    -In the development of rotors, The brushless DC motors are the way to go due to their high reliability and rasy control techniques.
  Most brushless motors are controlled via an Electronic Speed Controller, or for short ESC, to alternate the voltage inside the coils 
  so that the rotor part spin. 
    -Most motors used in rotors are called outrunners, which means that the outer part of the motor is spinning around a fixed coil of 
    copper wire windings inside, this type of motors allow for high Rpm, and thus higher controllability of the motor speed.
    -The ESC sends a recives a PWM signal which varies between 1000(min) to 2000(max) micro senconds on which it determines the voltage 
  that will alter the motor rpm and thus the speed and thrust it's providing.
    -Motors are commonly rated based on the Kv,which is the number of revolutions per minute (rpm) that a motor turns when 1V (one volt) 
  is applied with no load attached to that motor. A General rule of the thumb, Higher Kv means lower thrust and lower torque and a small
  propeller size, Lower Kv means Lower rpm , but higher thrust and higher rpm with a large propeller size.
