### Advantages than other adhesives (as epoxy):
- Light weight 
- shaped by hand with no bad effect on skin or bad smell 
- take less time to have the last hardness (depend on weather) 

The only disadvantage until now it is not much available in shops

## Procedure:
1)put the suitable amount of powder.

2)add the liquid until form a viscous liquid and cover it until soldering.
