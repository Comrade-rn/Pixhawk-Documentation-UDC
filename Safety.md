# Safety 
### In Dealing with components 
-  Fixing the components well by double tape helps in decreasing vibrations.  
1) Wires and connections:
     - Marking the ground wire (usually black or the darkest color) in self made extensions and plugs, also the ground socket in each component.    
     - Using heat shrink prevents short circuit happen between two uncovered wires. 
     - Tying the connections in place protect them from being under tension (which leads to connector losses) or being near the propellers.

2) Motor and ESC:
    - The connectors of each ESC and brushless motor should be well-isolated.   
    - While checking the ESC, motor and its rotation direction you must remove the propellers.   

3) Autopilot board:
    - Its too much risk to power up the pixhawk/arducopter with USB cable and battery at the same time. Only at ESC calibration by the Ground station instructions.

4) Telemetry: 
    - There is no risk to alternate between send and receive wires until you know where is the socket of each one.

5) Battery: 
   - Try to plug the lipo battery from one trial. Do not try too much it may cause something to burn.

### While first flight attempts 
- Use four ropes at each corner of the Quadcopter where the ropes are not in tension while taking off and hovering but when you notice much disturbance that may lead to damage or being out of control and falling pull the ropes quickly before the Quadcopter touch the ground.
- You may use knobs to surround a certain trial area but there is a piece of advice use a rubber band to tie the Quadcopter to be hanged in the trial area and away enough from the knobs at taking off.

### While Tuning 
- Use testing Stand it is like a universal joint gives you freedom in angles of yow, pitch and roll but you can not test the linear motion.  

### During Flight tests
- You should build enough knowledge about mode transition while flying
