- Batteries usually last for 10 to 20 minutes. 
- By the end of a flight, you will have to recharge your battery to prepare your quadcopter for another flight.
- For longer Endurance, you may use a power supply with a T- Connector.

- Almost all multicopters operate using LiPo batteries.
Choosing a battery:
A battery can be described by the following factors:
- Voltage
- Milliampere hours (mAh)
- Number of cells (s value)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Batteries are rated with 3 values:

- S value Determines maximum voltage output.
|||||||||||||| This tells you the number of cells in the battery.
|||||||||||||| 2S -> 2 cells 
|||||||||||||| 3S -> 3 cells 
|||||||||||||| Each cell produces approximately 3.7 volts.
|||||||||||||| 2S battery produces 7.4v, 3S battery produces 11.1v, etc

- mAh value Determines capacity of the battery.
|||||||||||||| This measures the batteryâ€™s charge storing capacity. 
|||||||||||||| In a 2700 mAh battery, you can draw 2700 milliamps for one hour, or 1 milliamp for 2700 hours.

- C value Determines maximum current draw.
|||||||||||||| This is the maximum safe continuous discharge rate of your battery.
|||||||||||||| To find discharge rate, multiply the C rating by the capacity.
|||||||||||||| e.g. maximum current discharge for a 25C, 2700 mAh battery is 25 x 2700 = 67,500 mA or 67.5 A. 
|||||||||||||| Discharging higher than this will cause your battery to heat up, bloat, and possibly explode.
|||||||||||||| Thus if you are using an 80A ESC, a 25C 2700 mAh battery would be insufficient.

- Watch this video to know how to charge the battery.

- Make sure to leave the battery on storage mode if you aren't intending to use it for a long period of time to maintain its health
   (Read the charger manual for more clarification on storage mode)

* A low voltage battery may trigger a fail-safe which can be observed from the ground station.

* If the male connector of the power module doesn't match the battery you have, you may do either of the following:
- Look for another battery which is of course better and much easier.
- For a last resort, you may need to change the type of connector on the battery. In this case :
|||||||||||||| Make sure the +ve and -ve terminals don't touch.
|||||||||||||| When soldering the new terminals, add heat shrink first,
               and double check before soldering the connnector because the connector terminals are "unique"
               i.e. (+ve and -ve can't be interchanged)
