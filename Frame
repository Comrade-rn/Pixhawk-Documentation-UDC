We used dji frame 350 cosists of four legs and two boards gathering the four legs.
At the end of each leg there are four holes for bolts to fix the motor
The fixation between legs and board is by 2x4 hexagonal screws 

Repairs on the frame after acceidents 
We used red accrelec a material that is bowder and liduid and used on matrials like carbon fiber and plastics
Advantages than other adhsieves (epoxy):
- Light weight 
- shaped by hand with no bad effect on skin or bad smell 
- take less time to have the last hardness (depend on weather) 
The only disadvantage until now it is not much available in shops
Procedure:)put the suitable amount of bowder 
2)add the liquid until form a viscous liquid and cover it until slodering 
3)put the solution around the crack and make sure that it is fixed with a good support
