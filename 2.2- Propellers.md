# Overview
A quadcopter uses two clockwise and two counterclockwise propellers.
- They are usually classified by their length and pitch.
- For example, 10Ã—4.5 propellers are 10 inch long and have a pitch of 4.5.
- There are two factors that characterize a propeller, dimension and material.
- You can know the recommended prop. size from the motor data.

-------------------------------
## Operation

- Each prop. has only one correct direction of rotation.
- A prop. is manufactured with a predetermined direction of rotation in order to push air in the correct direction.
- A clockwise prop can't substitute a counter clockwise prop.
- According to your quad configuration (e.g. Plus or X) motor spinning direction is determined.
- Always make sure your props are tight in place.
- Make sure to keep a safe distance from the props to avoid injury.
