# Overview

* The flight controller is a mix between a computer and a flight code that combined can perform stabilization and control over a certain aerial vehicle.
* Due to the instability nature of the quad rotor system , a stabilizing system is required and thus the choice of the Pixhawk flight controller is made.
* The pixhawk hardware runs an stm microprocessor with a PX4 flight stack (the software).
* Technical details and setup steps are documented and linked below in the official Pixhawk documentation.
