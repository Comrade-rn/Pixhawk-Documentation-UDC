# Overview

* The power distribution board (PDB) is a board that is used to create a parallel power connection between the main power source and the motors , such that each ESC receives equal voltages across its ends.


# Setup

* The PDB takes many forms of connections to the peripherals, for example
  1. T-connection (female - male)
  2. Bullet connection (female - male)
  3. Direct soldering the wire ends in their specified position 

* Most commonly used connection is the direct welding one. The ends has to be directly soldered to their equivalents on the board where ( positive (+) to positive (+) ) and negative (-) to negative (-) ). 


* There is usually a place for the power connection to the batteries on the side of the board where it’s usually a T connector or a bullet connector.

* The optimal procedure for installing the PDB is the following 
   1. Put solder on the PDB spots where the esc connections go.
   2. Put solder on the esc wires after twisting them well so no hairs can go outside the solder.
   3. Put the ends on their specified spots and then let the solder gun on the wire until it drowns in the weld pool and form a solid connection.
   4. Always check that everything is well soldered and strong.

   
   
   # Common Problems
   
   * Most problems arise from a bad weld most of the times or if the PDB break, in such cases the wire traces in the PDB layers might break or even cause a short circuit. It’s advisable to check every spot using the avo meter before connecting the esc such that each spot should provide the designated battery voltage.
